Abstract:
Our project focuses on addressing the problem of stunting through an innovative mobile application. Stunting, 
a serious health problem that affects children's growth and development, requires targeted interventions. 
Our research aims to explore the effectiveness of technology-based approaches in combating stunting. 
This app will provide good nutritional information and growth tracking. The information or research we get is on the website https://stunting.go.id/. 
Recognizing the critical need to combat the long-term impact of stunting on children's well-being, our team is motivated to leverage technology to provide broad and accessible solutions, 
aimed at making a meaningful impact on children's health.
